In this extension of the spell CHecker I found it very hard to get the hash table to behave the way I wanted to,
and it was hard to get the quicksort to work. I ended up having 6 extra "buckets" for the 6 values between
the upper and lower case letter, I figured this was alright because the added space is minimal and the added
simplicity is very beneficial.
